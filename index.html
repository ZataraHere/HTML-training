            This poem uses the dialect of the Caribbean, with its abbreviated grammar and characteristic rhythms. Limbo is not only the title of this poem, but also a lively dance in which the dancers use athleticism and muscular strength to pass under a horizontal stick, each dancer challenging the next to go lower.

            In this poem the limbo stick is a metaphor for slavery;<br> for the ship in which the future slaves travelled, for the whip that punishes them.

            The title <b>Limbo</b> is a pun. As well as a dance, limbo it is another word for purgatory, the state of existing on the edge of hell, suffering penance before being admitted to heaven.<br><br> This part of the Catholic Christian doctrine applies appropriately to those who suffered as slaves.

            The poem is divided into uneven, short-lined stanzas. The is no rhyme scheme. The poem derives its power from repetition and rhythm,<i>(as well as the imagery)</i> particularly the refrain <u>â€˜limbo, limbo like me.</u>
